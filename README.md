## [ESA Digital Twin Earth (DTE)](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/ESA_s_Digital_Twin_Earth_programme_building_a_virtual_model_for_a_changing_planet) Framework: Common DGGS for [DestinE](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Destination_Earth) and [Copernicus Sentinels](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu) Data

The growing volume and diversity of Earth Observation (EO) data from the Copernicus missions, combined with weather- and climate-related datasets from the Destination Earth (DestinE) initiative, require standardized, interoperable data frameworks. Current approaches rely on diverse data structures, spatial references, and storage formats, complicating the integration, visualization, and analysis of multi-source datasets.

To address these challenges, publicly documented advancements in **Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS)** and cloud-optimized data formats (such as **Zarr**) offer harmonized solutions. These technologies simplify data handling, streamline interoperability, and support diverse application scenariosâ€”including environmental monitoring, climate modeling, and operational decision-making for Earth system services.

Specifically, the **HEALPix (Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelisation)** framework provides a hierarchical, equal-area spherical representation ideal for multi-resolution applications. This approach has been adopted by DestinE for its Climate Digital Twin.

This initiative will develop and provide open documentation, standardized procedures, and tools necessary for operational deployment of HEALPix-based Zarr V3 data cube services tailored to the Copernicus program and the DestinE initiative.
